# Libraries of NemGame (NemGamingAkos)
### You may use them in any way you please
### Any dependency will be listed in the documentation
## JavaScript libraries
### [keys](libs/js/keys.js) - Handles keypresses on the keyboard, has a bindkey feature - [Documentation](documentation/js/keys.md)
## C++ libraries
### [input](libs/cpp/input.cpp) - A usable input. Never creates new lines, unless specifically told to do so - [Documentation](documentation/cpp/input.md)
## I'll put my libs on [ngakos.lol/libloader](https://www.ngakos.lol/libloader/) too
### Faster to access
## If something's wrong, create an Issue and I'll fix it when I have the time
### If there's a text you can't read, create an issue, it's probably misstyped or Hungarian and I forgot to translate it
