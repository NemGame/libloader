# Libraries of NemGame (NemGamingAkos)
### You may use them in any way you please
### All of my libraries are built on plain JavaScript, so no need for things like NodeJS
## Libraries
### [keys](libs/keys.js) - Handles keypresses on the keyboard, has a bindkey feature - [Documentation](documentation/keys.md)
## If something's wrong, create an Issue and I'll fix it when I have the time
### If there's a text you can't read, create an issue, it's probably misstyped or Hungarian and I forgot to translate it
